## Project Overview



I have developed a video game discovery application inspired by the RAWG platform. This application includes several useful features:

- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle:** Users can switch between dark and light modes for optimal viewing comfort.
- **Game Search:** Users can search for games by title or keyword.
- **Genre-Based Filtering:** Games can be filtered by genre to help users discover content tailored to their interests.
- **Loading Skeletons:** During data retrieval, loading skeletons are displayed to provide visual feedback to users.
- **Platform Filtering:** Users can filter games based on platforms such as PC, Xbox, etc.
- **Sorting Options:** Games can be sorted based on various criteria to facilitate browsing.

### Tech Stack
